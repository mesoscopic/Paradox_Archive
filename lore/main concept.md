# main concept
The crime lord Lorenz Montague is nearing death as their criminal empire is threatened by not only law enforcement, but a rival organization who has gotten their hands on devastating technology (nukes basically). The empire stands no chance without Lorenzâ€™s intellect and strategy, and they have no heir to teach, but now there is another way. His closest followers help him construct a network through which he can train an Artificial Intelligence model to replicate his decisions and keep his influence alive. The ARG takes place during the training process of the AI, where the Hivemind gets the chance, once they get past the physical and digital defenses of the model, to manipulate it in its most vulnerable phase to *attain whatever goal they wish for the criminal masterminds.*

What is seen cannot be unseen. But it also cannot be seen again. And the only way to rewind time is if someone takes the time to record it.

- Our Founder (Lorenz Montague)
