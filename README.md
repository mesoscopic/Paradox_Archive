# The Paradox Archive
The scraps of an ARG that could have been.

## Background
I wanted to make an ARG that was a lot better than the last one.
Enigma Hole had **so** *many* flaws, most notably the fact that it simply wasn't realistic.
I set out to make an ARG with a flawless suspension of disbelief.
It was... a bit too ambitious.
Ultimately, just to set up this thing would have cost me a lot of time and money.
And if nobody was going to play it, that wasn't worthwhile.
So here, I've archived all the ideas and files I'd went ahead and made, so you can see everything you've missed.
