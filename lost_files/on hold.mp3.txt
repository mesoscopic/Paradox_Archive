Hey, you might have seen this one before!
This was a (very) early draft for the music that would play when you were on hold with Paradox Advertising (yes, they have a phone number!)
I was planning to hide some secret messages in it too (since the "customer service employee" Tony Gimean is secretly me, you're going to be on hold for a while)
