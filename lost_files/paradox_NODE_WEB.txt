NODE_WEB was meant to be the website at the beginning of the ARG, which I had only started work on. It would serve many different purposes, including being the download point for the Paradox Vision extension.
You could submit your email address to get weekly emails from Paradox Advertising, which would be mostly useless but sometimes contain hint-ish things.
You were going to be able to sign up for an account, but I changed my mind and I was going to make the login page require a captcha that wasn't actually there, and some of the weekly emails would be about how "we're working on implementing captcha" which they never actually did. It's a fake business anyway, can't expect them to actually work on it :)
