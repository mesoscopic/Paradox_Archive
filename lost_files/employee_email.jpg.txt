The Paradox Vision extension was going to be an extension that you installed that would supposedly "show you opportunities for your advertising ventures."
Actually, it was going to be straight up spyware :)
But also, once in a while it would replace an ad on any website you visited with a Paradox Advertising one. These would mostly be useless, but you were meant to think that Paradox was an actual business and maybe this isn't a game after all...
Anyway, one of the ads would have had an oddly high definition picture of a "Paradox Employee" (this image with the screen edited) with their computer open to the Paradox login page, with their credentials typed in. This way you could finally log into Paradox Advertising, and a new link would appear: NODE 0
